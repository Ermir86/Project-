# This directory is intended for project specific (private) libraries

The source code of each library should be placed in a an own separate directory
("lib/your_library_name/[here are source files]").

For example, see a structure of the following two libraries `Foo` and `Bar`:

|--lib
|  |
|  |--Bar
|  |  |--docs
|  |  |--examples
|  |  |--src
|  |     |- Bar.py
|  |
|  |--Foo
|  |  |- Foo.py
|  |
|  |- README --> THIS FILE
|
|--src
   |- main.py
